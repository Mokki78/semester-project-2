# Semester-project-2
Description

This is the result of my Semester Project 2 for FED year two at Noroff Vocational School.

The assignment we got was to design and develop an auction site using Noroff.dev api, Bootstrap 5 and vanilla Javascript.
 Before developing we were tasked to make a design style, prototype and trello board and kalender to plan the project well ahead of starting the developing.

The assignment is to make a site where the user can enter and see auction listings and search them without having a registered profile witn the site, but to enable bidding on any auctions or make your own, you have to register. To register you have to have a valid Noroff student or staff email.

When registered you get a 1000 credit for bidding on listings, and you are supposed to be able to add/change avatar image for your profile and see your current credit. Your are also supposed to be able to make a post/auction yourself and see the bids of other listings.
