<h2>Description</h2>

<p><b>This is the result of my Semester Project 2 for FED year two at Noroff school of Technology and Digital media.</b>
The assignment we got was to design and develop an auction site using Noroff.dev Api, Bootstrap 5, SCSS/SASS vanilla Javascript.
 Before developing we were tasked to make a design style tyle, prototype and Trello board and calendar to plan the project before starting the developing.

The rules of the auction site: 
<ul>
 <li>the user can enter and see auction listings.</li>
 <li>the user can search aution listings without having a registered profile.</li>
  <li>when a user has a registered account, and they are logged in, they can make a bid in an auction.</li>
   <li>when a user has a registered account, and is logged in, they can make their own auction/post.</li>
   <li>to register for an account you need a valid Noroff staff, or student mail.</li>
  <li>when registering the user gets a 1000 credit. This credit, and they`re own posts, are to be displayed on their profile page.</li>
   <li>it should also be displayed their avatar image on the profile page, and this should be possible to change for a new avatar image.</li>
</ul>
